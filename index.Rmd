## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the following topics: (1) Political discourse on social media (particularly as it relates to bias and extremism; (2) international development (e.g., progress towards UN SDGs, intranational inequality); (3) international flows of money (i.e. microfinance, remittances); and (4) legislative productivity.
